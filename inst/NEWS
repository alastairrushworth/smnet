	CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1.1 30/03/2017
	-----------------------------------
	
	- updated network names in examples to avoid error due to attempt to overwrite a network 


	CHANGES IN VERSION 2.1 29/08/2016
	---------------------------------
	
	- network(max.df = ...) removed and replaced with network(fixed.df = ...), for fixing the 
	  degrees of freedom in a network smooth.
	- parameter combinations causing optimiser to encounter singular penalty matrices are now 
	  avoided.
	- fixed error with control = list(approx = 1) 
	- cyclical smooths via m(X, cyclical = T) and interactions via m(X, Y, cyclical = c(T, F))
	- n-dimensional smooth accepted using m()
	- removed ``network-node'' option for plot.smnet
	- removed dependency on 'igraphs'
	
	
	CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0 08/06/2015
	---------------------------------

  	- get_adjacency and smnet reworked so that SSN objects with multiple networks supported.  
	  get_adjacency now returns a list containing the adjacency matrix and the binary id table 
	  from the SSN object.
	- significant changes to plotting of spatial networks
	- dependence on 'dfoptim' package not required, optimiser changed to 'optim()'
	- show_weights() function added for exploring valid weights in data
	- automatic Shreve weights, "autoShreve"", option added for 'weights' argument in network if 
	  valid weights are not available
	- examples updated
