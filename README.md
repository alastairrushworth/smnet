## Note

This repo is no longer actively developed, however I will continue to
fix bugs and issues as and when they are reported. If you’d be
interested to take over maintenance and development of `smnet`, I’d be
happy to hear from you - please get in touch\!

## Overview

Fits flexible additive models to data on stream networks, taking account
of flow-connectivity of the network. Models are fitted using penalised
least squares.

## Installation

To install the development version of the package, use

``` r
remotes::install_github("alastairrushworth/smnet")
```

To install the CRAN version of the package, use

``` r
install.packages("smnet")
```
